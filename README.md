# Varb_Fun
a variable fun made small app in C++

what is a variable and where it is stored
a big question just like the other staffs i upload

we assume a variable with a type of X and name of Y
now lets assume a number of the same variable as Z 
now lets mix add or multiple them 
with the type of UNKNOWN and name of DONT_KNOW

type=ctype() or isType TypeOf [in Vb.net]

where we store the UNKNOWN and DONT_KNOW
i think mainly in memory 
and we use it as i think an ... OBJECT 

thanks
